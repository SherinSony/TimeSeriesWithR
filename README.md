# TimeSeriesWithR
Hi Friends,

This is a beginners guide to Time series programming with R.
I have included examples and citations from blogs and forums to answer everyone's basic questions.

The word document provides all the plots and diagrams as well.

This needs continous improvements.... Hope it helps you to start off !!
Happy Learning !

Regards
Sherin
